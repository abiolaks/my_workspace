# Recursion
## Understanding What Recursion is

### Below are the two things to consider -
* What is the least amount of work I can do
* when would the process complete - the stopping condition.

At each stage in recursion problem, you are not passing the same problem but the problem that brings you closer to the answer.

How can a large method and break it down into a sub problem where each invocation of the method or function get you close to the solution.

Recursion: This is a method that calls itself. It is condition on some parameter that when it is hit some condition at some point in time you will hit a base case - a stopping condition.

## Why use recursion
* it bridge the gap between elegance and complexity
* their is some slowness in calling a function
* recursion can reduce the need for complex
* it has an implicit stack. This could cause the program to run out of memory.
