# ZEN.
## The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters.

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than dense.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Readability counts.
* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
* Although practicality beats purity.
* Unless explicitly silenced.
* In the face of ambiquity, refuse the temptation to quess.
* There should be one-- anb preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
* Now is better than never.
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it is a bad idea.
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!.
